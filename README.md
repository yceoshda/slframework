# SpaceLife Framework

## Or Super Light Framework ...

### Basics

This framework is designed to include PHP latest features, be lightweight and as easy as possible to use.

This also means that you won't get super fancy ORM in it (a.k.a. learn to write proper SQL and design proper DB schema). You won't get super high end functionnalities. You won't get much as backward compatibility goes for PHP versions (5.5, maybe running on 5.4 with a few edits), and browsers (html 5, css 3 and decent JS).

But you'll get super light and fast execution.

The target being under 1 MB of peak memory usage and below 100ms execution time for simple pages (even a lot lot lot faster with OPCode caching mecanism such as OPCache or APC for prior PHP versions)

All the HTML part is made with Twitter BootStrap in mind (and TWBS is included as a compas/sass required). You can make your own stylesheet, but when naming your classes I strongly advise you to use the TWBS "convention".

### Docs

There should be (or at least will be ... in a not too distant future ;-)) docs to get you started in the 'doc' folder.

In short: do whatever you want with it, don't hold me responsible if it doesn't work !

I don't mind bug reports or feature(s) request(s), but this not being a full time job it may take a while to get a response :-)

If you like it, I won't mind a mention in your project !

If you want to give me money: read the above line ;-) and just continue building amazing new apps.
